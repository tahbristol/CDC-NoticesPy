# CDC-NoticesPy
A Python version of Ruby gem

This application displays travel advisories from the Centers For Disease Control.

Requirements:
  Python 3.6 https://www.python.org/downloads/
  pipenv https://github.com/pypa/pipenv

Installation:
  1. Clone or download the repo onto your system.
  2. Navigate to the repo's directory in your terminal.
  3. Run `pipenv --python 3.6 install`
  4. Run `pipenv shell`
  5. Run `python runNotices` to start the application.
  
  Alternatively if you know you have python 3.6 and you have pipenv installed then you can install the packages (beautifulsoup4 and   
  requests) manually. Then you can run step 5 like any other python script without the need for a pipenv shell.
  
Notes:
  Confirm that when you use the command `python` that it is running python 3.6
  
 Thanks!
